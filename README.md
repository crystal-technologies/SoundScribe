# SoundScribe
FREE live speech recognition system that works entirely on your computer. Your voice never leaves your system, so no internet required. Instead of paying other companies for processing your voice you can now use this program to do it all on your computer (if your computer can handle it). But definitely try giving it a shot to see whether it can work on your computer fluidly.

NOTE: This is very computation intensive and will require lots of RAM.

All you have to do to run this is head into the SoundScribe directory and run main.py. That's it! Of course after installing the required libraries for which you can just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on whatever python and pip version you are using to run the script. That's all you need to do, so good luck and have fun with it! Innovate, create, and publish your code just like this to help others, like this will be helping you. 

You're welcome
